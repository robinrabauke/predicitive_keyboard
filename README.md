# naive probabilistic language processing
## Intro
Inspired from the iOS-Keyboard this thing was created to teach students at University of TÃ¼bingen the basics of probabilistic natural language processing using simple things in prolog.

## What it does
Based on very tiny "knowledge" this program creates random sentences. Every new word is created by a Markov Model.

## How to use it
You will need SWI-Prolog to run it:

    cd /predictive_keyboard
    swipl predictive_keyboard.pl

In the swipl-console you just run:

`main.`

and it creates sentences for you.
